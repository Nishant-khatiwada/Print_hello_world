# Print_hello_world
# Alphabet Printing with Delay

This Python script generates and prints the lowercase alphabets from 'a' to 'z' in a stylized manner. It introduces a delay between each printed alphabet using the `time.sleep()` function. The script stops printing and exits the loop when the word "hello world" is formed.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

5. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
